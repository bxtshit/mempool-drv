what are mem pool drivers that use ioctl?

Mempool IOCTL Drivers are kernel modules that provide a mechanism for user-space applications to access and manage memory pools in the Linux kernel. These drivers allow an application to allocate, free, and configure mempools using IOCTL (Input/Output Control) commands. Mempool IOCTL Drivers are commonly used by high-performance network applications such as firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems to optimize memory usage and reduce CPU overhead.
